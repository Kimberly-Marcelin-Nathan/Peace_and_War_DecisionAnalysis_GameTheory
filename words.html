THIS FILE HAS ABOUT 3,300 WORDS TO TRANSLATE

TRANSLATION NOTES:

When translating this thing, only edit the stuff that's BETWEEN the <tags>, like so:

    <p id="still_english">hello</p>
    =>
    <p id="still_english">bonjour</p>

Also, DON'T change anything between the [square brackets], like so:

    Number #[N]
    =>
    Numero #[N]

Exception to the "don't change tags" rule:
Feel free to move around the italics & bold tags, so that the emphasis
on the right phrases/words still makes sense!

    <i>italics</i>
    <b>bold</b>

Also, some HTML weirdness you might want to know:

    &amp; is an ampersand "&" sign
    &#8226; is a dot
    &rarr; is a rightward-facing arrow
    &lt; is a "<" sign

ALSO! I'd love for you to credit yourself as a translator!
You can add your own name in the <p id="subtitle"> section

Thanks again!
~ Nicky Case

<b>THE PEACE-WAR GAME</b>
<br>
You have one choice.
In front of you is a machine: if you put a coin in the machine,
the <i>other player</i> gets three coins – and vice versa.
You both can either choose PEACE (put in coin), or WAR (don't put in coin).
</p>

<p id="oneoff_0_btm">
<b>Let's say the other player chooses war, and doesn't put in a coin.</b><br>
What should you do?
</p>

<p id="oneoff_1_cheated">
Exactly! Why let that moocher mooch off of you?
</p>

<p id="oneoff_1_cooperated">
Alas, turning the other cheek just gets you slapped!
</p>

<p id="oneoff_1_top">
If you choose peace &amp; they choose war, you lose a coin while they gain +3. (score: -1 vs +3)
However, if you both choose war, neither of you gain or lose anything. (score: 0 vs 0)
<b>Therefore: choose WAR XD.</b>
</p>

<p id="oneoff_1_btm">
<b>But let's say the other player chooses peace, and puts in a coin.</b><br>
What should you do now?
</p>

<p id="oneoff_2_cheated">
Wow, that's mean... and also the correct answer!
</p>

<p id="oneoff_2_cooperated">
Sure, seems like the right thing to do... <b>OR IS IT??</b>
</p>

<p id="oneoff_2_top">
Because if you both choose peace, you both give up a coin to gain +3. (score: +2 vs +2)
But if you choose war &amp; they choose peace, you gain +3 coins at their cost of one. (score: +3 vs -1)
<b>Therefore: "should" choose WAR XD.</b>
</p>

<p id="oneoff_2_btm">
And <i>that's</i> our dilemma.
Trust is nice, but it can let others take advantage of you -- or shoot you as you come unarmed out of a trench.
Sometimes, distrust <i>is</i> rational!
But now, what happens if we play this game...

<b>Now, let's play for real.</b>
You'll be playing against 5 different opponents, each with their own game "strategy".
With each opponent, you'll play anywhere between 3 to 7 rounds.
(You won't know in advance when the last round is)
Can you trust them? Or rather... can they trust <i>you?</i>

Hello! I start with Cooperate, and afterwards, I just copy whatever you did in the last round. Meow

<b>GRUDGER:</b>
Duh Listen, pardner. I'll choose peace, and keep cooperatin',
but if y'all ever choose to cheat me by choosing war, I'LL CHEAT YOU BACK 'TIL THE END OF TARNATION.

<p id="character_prober">
<b>DETECTIVE:</b>
First: I analyze you. I start: Cooperate with peace, Cheat with war, Cooperate with peace and Cooperate.
If you cheat back, I'll act like <span class="tft">Copycat</span>.
If you never cheat back, I'll act like <span class="all_d">Always Cheat</span>, to exploit you.
Elementary, my dear Watson XD.
