!["The Peace-War Game"]

*The Peace-War Game | Kimberly-Marcelin-Nathan*

The project is a web-based interactive guide focused on exploring game theory 
concepts related to trust and cooperation through the lens of the "Peace-War Game."
It comprises HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that collectively create an 
immersive user experience. The HTML files define the structure of the web interface,
including elements for loading, the main slideshow, and footer components. 
Meanwhile, the JavaScript files orchestrate the functionality and behavior
of the application, managing slides, transitions, and user interactions.
The core content for translation is contained within a separate HTML file,
which includes text content for titles, descriptions, instructions, and 
character profiles. The project aims to educate users about decision-making
in scenarios of trust and conflict, particularly emphasizing the dynamics of
iterated games, where repeated interactions between players influence strategic
choices and outcomes. Through engaging visuals and interactive elements,
the project seeks to provide a deeper understanding of trust dynamics and 
strategic thinking in social interactions.
